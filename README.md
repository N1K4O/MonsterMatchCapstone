# MonsterMatchCapstone
Capstone Project KU
This is a project created to serve as the Capstone deliverable for Group 5 on the BSIT KU program (Nicolas De Oliveira, Jeffrey Mullins, Ben Larson, Christopher Quinn, Jordan Shook-Rothenberg)

The goal of this project is to create a fun and interactive game for anyone's Halloween Party. 
MonsterMatch will be a hybrid version of a dating application where people will interact with each other to figure out trivia questions and learn more about each other characters.
The game will have users log in and chose a character to play as and will  recieve the lore of the character to fully understand them. With that they will be given a task to find their soulmates. This goal will give them many points if they are able to match with the other person and recognize them as their soulmate. 
The game will contain many other "mini-games" that will have trivia questions for the players to complete after successfully completing a "Speed date" with the other monsters that they match with.

The requirements for this project are:
* Interactive character selection page.
* User account where they can store their infomration and images. 
* Users should be able to log in and upload a picture of themselves on their costume.
* They need to be able to see the infomration of their own characters only.
* Database to store user information as well as character details.
* Database needs to interact with the website seemlessly.
* Site needs to be constructed in such a way that users of any type of phone will be able to use it and find their information. (Reactive)
* THE GAME MUST BE FUN
