<h4>Crypt Keeper - Elijah - Lawyer</h4>

<p align="left">
    The story for our party is:<br>
    You as the Lawyer has been passed down a task to meet with a very wealthy family that has just recently lost their father figure. This man was named Victor, and he was the owner of an Italian restaurant that “The Gabagoul” that has been around for many generations. This family has the history of being involved on many conspiracies that no one knows to be true.

As the Lawyer you will be attending the reunion and reading Victors will and passing down ownership of the belongings.<br><br>

    Game Start:<br>

    Read out to all the players:<br>

    “We are all here today to celebrate the life of Pappa Victor, he was a great man and lover of pasta. His trinity of
    joy always has been women, money and pasta. Please pay attention to all of the following instructions that Victor
    has given us to distribute his wealth.”<br><br>

    Victors Will:<br><br>

    To my beloved family, I know that you are all upset with my passing but I want you all to celebrate my life and most
    of all to squabble over my money (Wahahahahaha) [Yes he did write Wahahahaha].<br><br>

    I remember the good old days when I would go down to the park and watch my favorite baseball team the Big City
    Wombats. They were a horrible team but I always bet against them so they made me loads of money throughout my life.<br><br>

    Some of my cherished memories were the Christmas mornings where the kids would run around playing with each other
    and making a mess out of things. All the women in the house preparing the food and the smell of my sister’s secret
    sauce in the air. Francesca always had the best Bolognese sauce to put on my pasta.<br><br>

    But for sure the most fun was to watch as everyone at the table argued with each other over some comment that was
    made. The mayhem was delightful and made me so happy to see. I have to admit that most of the things that I said at
    the table were not the things that I believed in, but I knew I would get a kick out of the reactions. Like when I
    said that I was not about to have a doctor looking into my behind business just to check.<br><br>

    Enough of talking about me, lets get to why you are all united here. I will leave the restaurant, my money, and all
    that I have ever owned to the one that knows me best. To find out who that is I prepared a series of questions about
    my life.<br><br>

    I will give time for all of you to meet each other and discuss what you loved in me the most.<br><br>

    Elijah, my lawyer should be the one reading this to you all, he will now separate you into pairs and you need to
    discuss with each other what is it that you liked the most about me. And how much you miss me.<br><br>

    Each of these “dates” will be 3 minutes long and a switch will happen for you to speak to a different person.<br><br>

    Once you have completed the dates with everyone you will be set to take a trivia quiz about me. For each of the
    questions right you will be granted 1 candy corn. Please don’t eat them they are the same ones that sit on our
    reception year round.<br><br>

    Also, as the father of this family I understand the deepest wants from all of you. I have given Elijah the
    description of who you are and what your wants are. If you do fulfil your wants during this event you will be
    granted extra 5 candy corns.<br><br>

    Have fun kids, and you too sister.”<br><br>

    After Dates are done:<br><br>

    Read out Trivia questions to the Party members. Give out 1 candy corn for each of the members that get the answer
    correctly.<br><br>

    When they are done with trivia, ensure start asking each of the members for their goals and if they have identified
    who their targets are and if their goals have been met. For each of the goals completed award 5 candy corns. (I the
    murderer finds the angel they are awarded 10 points If the murderer misses who the angel is, they loose 5 points)<br><br>

    In the end count the candy corns and the winner is the one with most Candy corns.
