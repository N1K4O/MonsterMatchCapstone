        <h2>Game Structure</h2>
        <p>When finding people to party with have them select a character and instruct them to dress up as that
            character for the party.<br><br>

            Have them look over their character’s lore and secret goals beforehand so they are familiar with it.<br><br>

            Once everyone arrives and you are ready to play, have the crypt keeper set the scene and start the “speed
            dating portion” Have each person partner up for 3-minute-long rounds to find out information about everyone
            else and Papa Victor.<br><br>

            After time is up have the players switch partners and then repeat the process until everyone has partnered
            with each other once<br><br>

            After that is the trivia portion, round up all the players and click the trivia button located under the how
            to play button.<br><br>

            From there read off as many trivia questions as you want, in whatever order you want, one at a time to the
            room. Players may not answer questions about themselves.<br><br>

            When a player gets a question right, they get a candy corn (real or imaginary).<br><br>

            Whoever has the most candy corn at the end wins. In the event of a tie, you decide how to handle that.</p>
