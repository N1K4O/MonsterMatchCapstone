<h4>Murderer – Frank – Son</h4>

<p align="left">
    Frank is the son of Victor, he has grown up in this family of crazy Italians that love arguing and that infuriates
    him. He does not like anyone that is related to him including his late father.<br><br>

    He received a call a few days ago giving notice of his father’s death. He was shocked to know that he has fallen ill
    and died from prostate cancer, he has been sick for a few months but has not told anyone, so to everyone it seams
    that he died suddenly. Since he was the only direct emergency contact Frank is the only one that knows this info.<br><br>

    Frank was called to attend the reading of his fathers will and to bring his lover Juliet. He loves Juliet very much
    and he would do anything for her. There is a lot of jealousy on Franks life, every time someone gets on the way of
    his relationship he can be very aggressive.<br><br>

    Frank Blames his aggressive nature on his father Victor. When he was little he remembers Victor always being rude to
    all of the people on the street, he remembers that his father loved going to play bingo on Sundays and that he
    always got on argument with the other seniors.<br><br>

    Frank is sure that someone in that reading will try to make a move on his lover Franks goal is to stop whomever it
    is to do so by pinpointing who the person’s “wingman” is.
