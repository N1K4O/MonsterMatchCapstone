<h4>Lost Soul 1 – Juliet – Frank’s lover</h4>

<p align="left">
    Juliet is the lover of Frank, son of Victor. She is a young woman that has been together with Frank since early
    Highschool. Now many years later she finds herself completely done with their relationship. Frank has proven to her
    that he is not a good partner and lashes out all the time whenever someone just talks to her.<br><br>

    She works as a teacher at a middle school and loves to spend her time with kids, as well as good family time. When
    she goes to Franks family events she feels out of place. Everyone seems rude and argues a lot, they all make the
    worst possible comments to each other and try to make each other’s lives miserable.<br><br>

    Aunt Francesca was always nice to her and had her well-being in mind. Whenever she was frustrated in the house, he
    would make sure to have someone help her do something away from the rest.<br><br>

    Victor, Frank’s father, has passed away but Frank does not seem to care too much about it. Strangely enough you were
    invited to the will reading to partake in the reunion. Maybe the old man left something to you, and you can use it
    to leave Frank and rebuild your life.<br><br>

    Victor was a grumpy man that never took interest on you, he always seemed distant but attentive. You are used to
    waking up early and usually when spending time on his house with Frank the mornings would be you and him playing
    Cribbage and drinking Coffee.<br><br>

    Juliet’s goal: Find your soul mate but don’t let Frank find out.
