<h4>Ghosts – People in the Reunion – Not named family members</h4>

<p align="left">
    As a ghost your job on this game is to make sure to confuse everyone. Making sure that goals are not met and that
    stories are not told correctly.<br><br>

    Victor, the deceased, was a good man and businessman. He hired you to be part of this will reading and to make sure
    that his family is taken care of. He requested that you make up facts about him and talks about him like you know
    him.<br><br>

    Your names can be picked at your discretion. (Picking names is optional, you can use your own)<br><br>

    Ghosts goal: Make sure that no one meets their goal.
