<h4>Grim Reaper – “Lennie” – Officer Phill (Cop)</h4>

<p align="left">
    Lennie is a police officer that has been working for Victor for many years, Victor used to pay him to do the
    security on the restaurant and some of the other businesses around the neighborhood for him.<br><br>

    Lennie chose this name when she was a little kid and would play with Victor on the street. There was this old lady
    that sold candy to them, and they were not allowed to tell er their real names, so Phill invented this name “Lennie”
    to be able to go there and buy candy, this was an idea that Victor gave him. Phill liked the name so much that he
    adopted it as his nickname.<br><br>

    Victor and Lennie have been close ever since then, they helped each other through many tough times, and Lennie made
    sure to keep everyone safe and out of trouble with the rest of the police. He would love to play with the kids and
    participate in family reunions with everyone but usually he was on call working on cases around the neighborhood.<br><br>

    Lennie heard the news of Victor’s passing and immediately went to the hospital to pay his condolences; he was the
    first one there. And the one to sign the forms. None of the family members were present when Victor passed away, and
    Lennie didn’t even want to know what did it at the time. He was just sad that his best friend was gone.<br><br>

    Now he was invited to the will reading. Lennie is just worried that some people in the family can get aggressive and
    try to go at each other for the money that Victor left behind.<br><br>

    Lennie’s goal: Don’t let people argue with each other. (Successful when addressed by the Crypt Keeper)
