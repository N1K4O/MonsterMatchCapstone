<h4>Lost Soul 2 – Loui</h4>

<p align="left">
    You are the son of Francesca and nephew of Victor. You loved Victor and he was an example of man to you. He was a
    self-made Italian businessman that put together a restaurant that serves delicious food and takes care of other
    families other than his own. Loui is proud to be a part of their family and to work at Victor’s Cantina.<br><br>

    Loui always enjoyed going to family reunions where all his cousins and uncles and aunts would argue over the most
    ridiculous topics. They always had a blast and no one ever left without uncles Victor’s blessing… Well except that
    one time when Frank barged out of the house mad at the world because some dude was sending letters to his girl.
    Uncle Lennie had to stop him and it was a mess, they almost had to take him in for hitting uncle Lennie. That guy is
    no good.<br><br>

    Juliet is pretty nice and good with the little ones in the house since she is a teacher. Shame that she is together
    with Frank, that eyesore. Mom always has good things to say about her but Frank is so protective of her that I don’t
    even want to step on the same room as her.<br><br>

    Mom is a great cook and the chef at the cantina. I serve and host the place making sure that everyone Is taken care
    of. There are many good times in our cantina, and it is 100% a family environment. Sometimes some friends of Uncle
    Victor come after hours to play poker on the back by his office. There was always a lot of money that he made during
    the games, sometimes I even got large tips for watching the door. Uncle Lennie was always there to watch over the
    restaurant from his car, it was very creepy and odd, I know he is a cop but still… IDK it is just creepy.<br><br>

    I (Loui) have been invited to the reading to the will, hopefully there is some good news there. I hope that the
    restaurant stays with Mom (Francesca). I wouldn’t like to have it on the hands of Frank even him being the son. He
    has nothing to do with the Cantina, I bet he doesn’t even know the name of the place.<br><br>

    Loui’s goal: Find your soulmate but don’t let Lennie know.
